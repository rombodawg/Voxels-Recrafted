**Mod Description:**
--------------------

This is my version of theÂ [Minecraft: Remade & Remastered](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--ZpBg1Chts&pp=ygUhbWluZWNyYWZ0IHJlbWFrZSBtb2RwYWNrIG1vZHJpbnRo)Â Modpack but instead its made for Forge so I could have the Aether mod added since Aether is my favorite.

This modpack includes everything you could imagine to remake Minecraft into a full new and fresh feeling experience.

Beefy graphics card are required for this modpack as the main shaders included are SUES PTGI for the best quality path tracing (Ray tracing).
